This directory contains ERGO programs for game playing as described in Chapter
5 of the book.  These games use BATs as usual, but no programming
constructs. They call "ergo-play-game" instead of "ergo-do".

The directory contains the following:

    - README.txt                    This file
    - ttt.scm                       The game of TicTacToe
    - pousse-main.scm               The game of Pousse
